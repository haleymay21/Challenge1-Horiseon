## Description

I was given an HTML and CSS code to edit to ensure it follows accesibility standards so that the site is optimized for search engines. I changed non-semantic elements to semantic elements when appropriate, I ensured a logical structure for html elements, created accesible alt attributes, fixed heading attributes to be in sequential order, changed the title to be consise and descriptive.

Additionally, I fixed the links in the nav bar and added accesible commenting to both HTML and CSS codes.
